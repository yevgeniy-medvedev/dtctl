# Token Scopes Reference

This document lists the Dynatrace platform token scopes required for each safety level. Copy the scope list for your desired safety level when creating a token in Dynatrace.

> **Note**: Safety levels are client-side only. The token scopes you configure in Dynatrace are what actually controls access. Configure your tokens with the minimum required scopes for your use case.
>
> **Ownership checks are also client-side**: The `readwrite-mine` safety level and `--mine` flag work by comparing the resource owner ID with your user ID locally. The Dynatrace API does not enforce ownership restrictions—if your token has write access, you can modify any resource that is shared with a user. The ownership check is a convenience feature to prevent accidental modifications to shared resources.

## Quick Reference

| Safety Level | Use Case | Token Type |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| `readonly` | Production monitoring, troubleshooting | Read-only token |
| `readwrite-mine` | Personal development, sandbox | Standard token |
| `readwrite-all` | Team environments, administration | Standard token |
| `dangerously-unrestricted` | Dev environments, bucket management | Full access token |

For creating platform tokens, see [Dynatrace Platform Tokens documentation](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/manage/identity-access-management/access-tokens-and-oauth-clients/platform-tokens).

## Recommended Scopes by Safety Level
