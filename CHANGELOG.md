# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Cross-client skill installation** — `dtctl skills install --cross-client` installs skills to the shared `~/.agents/skills/` directory defined by the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) convention, so any compatible agent automatically discovers them without needing per-agent installation

## [0.20.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **TOON output for `query` and `verify query`** — `-o toon` is now accepted by `dtctl query` and `dtctl verify query`; previously the command-level format allowlists omitted `toon` even though the printer already supported it
- **`verify query` format validation** — `dtctl verify query` now rejects unsupported output formats with a clear error instead of silently falling through to the human-readable default

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- **TOON output format** — new `-o toon` output format using [TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)](https://github.com/toon-format/toon), a compact encoding optimised for LLM token efficiency (~40-60% fewer tokens vs JSON for tabular data); use `-A -o toon` in agent mode for maximum token savings
- **Windows installation guide** — comprehensive installation documentation for Windows users, including a PowerShell install script (`install.ps1`) and platform-specific troubleshooting

### Changed
- **`describe` commands respect `-o` flag** — all `describe` subcommands now support `--output json|yaml|toon|csv` and agent mode (`-A`); previously most describe commands hardcoded `fmt.Printf` output and ignored the format flag; fixed partial implementations in `describe lookup` (inverted routing), `describe extension` and `describe extension-config` (dead `outputFormat == ""` check)
- **Live Debugger marked experimental** — Live Debugger features are now documented as experimental; underlying APIs and query behavior may change in future releases

### Fixed
- **Settings API pagination** — fixed HTTP 400 errors on page 2+ when listing settings with filters; the Settings API rejects `schemaIds` and `scopes` query parameters when `nextPageKey` is present (all params are embedded in the page token); these params are now only sent on the first request

## [0.19.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed
- **Pagination: filter dropped on page 2+** — all paginated list endpoints placed filter/search query parameters inside the first-page-only branch of the pagination loop; page tokens do not always preserve filter context server-side (confirmed on the Document API), causing subsequent pages to return unfiltered results; e.g., `dtctl get dashboards` on environments with many documents fetched all document types instead of just dashboards
- **Pagination: page-size dropped on page 2+ (Document API)** — the Document API accepts `page-size` alongside `page-key` and does not embed the page size in the token (defaulting to 20/page if omitted); combined with the filter bug, this caused `dtctl get dashboards` on a 1,307-dashboard environment to make ~229 HTTP requests over ~2 minutes instead of 3 requests in ~5 seconds
- **`--chunk-size` default restored to 500** — reverts the v0.19.0 change that set the default to 0 (first page only), which silently truncated results for all resources; the underlying pagination bugs are now fixed properly

### Changed
- **Cleaner CLI output** — centralized message formatting with new `PrintHumanError`, `PrintHint`, `DescribeKV`, `DescribeSection` helpers; bold labels in `describe` output; bold `--help` section headers; softer status colors in tables; fixed table header misalignment caused by a `tablewriter` ANSI-width bug
- **Removed `-o describe` output format** — the redundant `--output describe` format on `get` commands has been removed; use `dtctl describe <resource>` instead

## [0.19.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **Workflow task result retrieval** — new `dtctl get wfe-task-result <execution-id> --task <name>` command retrieves the structured return value of a specific workflow task (e.g., the object returned by a JavaScript task's `default` export function); previously this data was only accessible through the raw REST API
- **`exec workflow --show-results`** — new `--show-results` flag for `dtctl exec workflow --wait` prints each task's structured return value after the execution completes, removing the need for separate `get wfe-task-result` calls per task; in agent mode, task results are included in the JSON envelope
- **Environment URL confusion detection** — dtctl now detects common URL misconfiguration (e.g., `live.dynatrace.com` instead of `apps.dynatrace.com`, bare `dynatrace.com`, or missing `.apps.` on internal domains) and prints corrective suggestions; surfaces in `dtctl doctor` as a dedicated check, as warnings during `auth login` and `ctx set`, and as hints on 401/403/connection errors
- **Junie agent support** — `dtctl skills install --for junie` installs skill files for the Junie IDE agent; includes auto-detection via `JUNIE` env var and both project-local (`.junie/skills/dtctl/`) and global (`~/.junie/skills/dtctl/`) install paths

### Changed
- **Skills: migrate to agentskills.io standard** — `dtctl skills install` now copies the full skill directory (`SKILL.md` + `references/`) using the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard path (`<client>/skills/dtctl/`) instead of agent-specific file formats; YAML frontmatter and relative links are preserved verbatim; existing installations should run `dtctl skills uninstall && dtctl skills install` to migrate
- **Default `--chunk-size` changed from 500 to 0** — list commands now return only the first page of results by default (matching kubectl behavior); this fixes a performance regression where environments with many documents made 200+ sequential API requests taking 4+ minutes; users who need all results should pass `--chunk-size 500` explicitly
- **Global skill installs for more agents** — `dtctl skills install --global` now supports Copilot (`~/.copilot/skills/dtctl/`), OpenCode (`~/.config/opencode/skills/dtctl/`), and Junie (`~/.junie/skills/dtctl/`) in addition to previously supported agents

### Fixed
- **Slow pagination on large environments** — the Document API ignores the `page-size` parameter and always returns ~20 items per page; after the pagination fix in v0.18.0, this caused list commands to issue hundreds of sequential requests; resolved by defaulting `--chunk-size` to 0
- **Embedded skill files with CRLF on Windows** — added `.gitattributes` rules to force LF line endings for embedded skill files, fixing frontmatter detection failures (`"---\n"` prefix check) when building on Windows with `autocrlf=true`

## [0.18.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- **OpenClaw agent support** — `dtctl skills install --for openclaw` installs SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter and reference files to the OpenClaw workspace skills directory; includes auto-detection via `OPENCLAW` env var, global install support, and proper cleanup on uninstall
- **Visual output improvements** — bold table headers, status-aware coloring (green/red/yellow for known states), dimmed UUIDs, colored error prefix, dimmed empty-state message; all styling respects `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR`, `--plain`, and TTY detection

### Changed
- **Consistent stderr messaging** — all success, warning, and info messages now use dedicated `PrintSuccess`/`PrintInfo`/`PrintWarning` helpers that write to stderr, ensuring stdout stays clean for piping and scripting; covers auth, ctx, config, alias, lookups, azure, and all create/edit/delete flows

### Fixed
- **Describe label formatting** — underscores in struct tags now render as spaces (e.g., `Display Name` instead of `Display_name`), and known acronyms (ID, UUID, SLO, URL, API, HTTP, etc.) are preserved in their uppercase form
- **Pagination page-size errors** — fixed HTTP 400 errors on paginated requests for extensions, SLOs, IAM, and document resources by not sending `page-size` together with `page-key`/`next-page-key`

## [0.15.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
### Added
- **Live Debugger CLI workflow** (experimental -- underlying APIs and query behavior may change)
  - `dtctl update breakpoint --filters ...` for workspace filter configuration
  - `dtctl create breakpoint <file:line>` for breakpoint creation
  - `dtctl get breakpoints` with breakpoint ID in default table output
  - `dtctl describe <id|filename:line>` for breakpoint rollout/status breakdown
  - `dtctl update breakpoint <id|filename:line> --condition/--enabled`
  - `dtctl delete breakpoint <id|filename:line|--all>` with confirmation / `-y` / `--dry-run`
- **Snapshot query decoding**
  - `dtctl query ... --decode-snapshots` decodes Live Debugger snapshot payloads with simplified plain values
  - `dtctl query ... --decode-snapshots=full` preserves full decoded tree with type annotations
  - Composable with any output format (`-o json`, `-o yaml`, `-o table`, etc.)
- **TOON output format** — new `-o toon` output format using [TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation)](https://github.com/toon-format/toon), a compact encoding optimised for LLM token efficiency; achieves ~40-60% fewer tokens vs JSON for tabular data while preserving lossless round-trip fidelity; use `-A -o toon` to enable in agent mode


### Documentation
- Added/updated Live Debugger documentation in:
  - `docs/LIVE_DEBUGGER.md`
  - `docs/QUICK_START.md`
  - `docs/dev/API_DESIGN.md`
  - `docs/dev/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- **Generic document resource** — full lifecycle management for Dynatrace documents via `dtctl get/describe/create/edit/delete/history/restore document`; supports all document types stored in the Document API

### Changed
- **DQL query `--metadata` flag** — include response metadata (e.g. query cost, execution time) in query output; supports format-specific rendering and an optional field allow-list to restrict which metadata fields are shown

### Fixed
- **Document version field unmarshalling** — the `version` field is now correctly handled whether the API returns it as a string or an integer, preventing unmarshalling errors on certain document types

## [0.14.4] - 2026-03-10

### Changed
- **`dtctl skills install` minimal output** — installed skill files now contain only `SKILL.md` (~283 lines / ~10 KB) instead of inlining all reference documents (~1,100 lines / ~35 KB); reference docs remain embedded in the binary but are no longer concatenated into the installed file

## [0.14.3] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed
- **`dtctl doctor` false token failure** — the token check now uses the same OAuth-aware token resolution path as all other commands; previously it called `cfg.GetToken()` directly which cannot handle OAuth tokens stored in compact keyring format, causing `[FAIL] Token: cannot retrieve token "...-oauth": token not found` even when the context was fully functional

## [0.14.2] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Kiro Powers support** — `dtctl skills install --for kiro` installs skill files in [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev/)'s Powers format
  - Generates `POWER.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `displayName`, `description`, `keywords`, `author`) in `.kiro/powers/dtctl/`
  - Powers activate dynamically in Kiro based on keyword matching in conversations
  - Automatic detection of Kiro via `KIRO` environment variable
  - Works with all existing skills subcommands: `install`, `uninstall`, `status`

  - `dtctl skills status` shows installation status across all supported agents
  - Auto-detects the current AI agent environment when `--for` is omitted
  - `--global` flag for user-wide installation (supported agents only)
  - `--force` flag to overwrite existing skill files
  - `--list` flag to show all supported agents without installing
  - Agent-mode structured output for all subcommands

  - `make test-update-golden` to update after intentional changes
  - Windows line-ending normalization for cross-platform CI
