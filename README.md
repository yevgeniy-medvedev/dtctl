**Your Dynatrace platform, one command away.**

`dtctl` is a CLI for the Dynatrace platform — manage workflows, dashboards, queries, and more from your terminal or let AI agents do it for you. Its predictable verb-noun syntax (inspired by `kubectl`) makes it easy for both humans and AI agents to operate.

```bash
dtctl get workflows                           # List all workflows
dtctl query "fetch logs | limit 10"           # Run DQL queries
dtctl apply -f workflow.yaml --set env=prod   # Declarative configuration
dtctl get dashboards -o json                  # Structured output for automation
dtctl exec copilot nl2dql "error logs from last hour"
```

## Why dtctl?

- **Built for AI agents** — Predictable verb-noun commands, structured output (`--plain`, `-o json`, `--agent`), machine-readable command catalog (`dtctl commands`), and YAML-based editing make dtctl a natural tool for LLM-driven automation
- **Agent output envelope** — `--agent` flag (auto-detected in AI environments) wraps all output in a structured JSON envelope with `ok`/`result`/`error`/`context` fields, follow-up suggestions, and pagination metadata
- **Agent Skill included** — Ships with an [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) that teaches AI assistants how to operate your Dynatrace environment
- **Familiar CLI conventions** — `get`, `describe`, `edit`, `apply`, `delete` — if you (or your AI) know `kubectl`, you already know dtctl
- **Watch mode** — Real-time monitoring with `--watch` flag for all resources
- **Multi-environment** — Switch between dev/staging/prod with a single command
- **Template support** — DQL queries with Go template variables
- **Shell completion** — Tab completion for bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell
- **[NO_COLOR](https://no-color.org/) support** — Color is automatically disabled when piped; respects `NO_COLOR` env var and `FORCE_COLOR=1` override

## AI Agent Skill

dtctl ships with an [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) at `skills/dtctl/` — a compact command reference that teaches AI coding assistants how to use dtctl effectively. Agents can also bootstrap themselves at runtime with `dtctl commands --brief -o json` to discover all available verbs, flags, and resources.

**Install via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh):**

```bash
npx skills add dynatrace-oss/dtctl
```

**Or install with dtctl itself:**

```bash
dtctl skills install              # Auto-detects your AI agent
dtctl skills install --for claude   # Or specify explicitly
dtctl skills install --cross-client # Cross-client (.agents/skills/)
dtctl skills install --global     # User-wide (supported agents)
dtctl skills status               # Check installation status
```

**Or copy manually:**

```bash
cp -r skills/dtctl ~/.agents/skills/                       # Cross-client (any agent)
cp -r skills/dtctl ~/.github/skills/                       # For GitHub Copilot
cp -r skills/dtctl ~/.claude/skills/                       # For Claude Code
cp -r skills/dtctl ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/dtctl/     # For OpenClaw
```

Compatible with GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Kiro, Junie, OpenCode, OpenClaw, and other [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io)-compatible tools. Use `--cross-client` to install once for all agents.

## Quick Start

Cross-platform way with no prerequisites:
1. Download a binary for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/releases/latest)
2. Extract the archive to any folder
3. Add the folder to `PATH` environment variable 
4. Run `dtctl version` to verify installation and authentication

```bash
# Install via Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install dynatrace-oss/tap/dtctl
```

```powershell
# Install via PowerShell (Windows)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

```bash
# Or build from source:
git clone https://github.com/dynatrace-oss/dtctl.git && cd dtctl && make install

# Authenticate via OAuth (recommended — no token management needed)
dtctl auth login --context my-env --environment "https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com"
# Opens your browser for Dynatrace SSO login, tokens are stored automatically

# Alternative: token-based authentication
# dtctl config set-context my-env \
#   --environment "https://abc12345.apps.dynatrace.com" \
#   --token-ref my-token
# dtctl config set-credentials my-token --token "dt0s16.YOUR_TOKEN"

# Verify everything works
dtctl doctor

# Go!
dtctl get workflows
dtctl describe workflow "My Workflow" -o yaml  # Structured output
dtctl query "fetch logs | limit 10"
dtctl apply -f workflow.yaml --set env=prod    # Template variables
dtctl create lookup -f error_codes.csv --path /lookups/production/errors --lookup-field code
```
